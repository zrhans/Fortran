Fortran program source codes
----------------------------
The Fortran program source codes for all Sample Problems are give here:

     folder f90/     - program sources with .f90 extension
     folder f95/     - the same program sources but with .f95 extension
     folder zipped/  - all program sources in a single compressed archive
                       (various compression types: .zip, .tgz, .bz2).


Compilers
---------
All program sources have been tested with the following Fortran 95 compilers:

-   Intel Fortran Compiler (version 8)
-   Salford FTN95 (version 04-08-2004)
-   Gnu G95 compiler (version 10-11-2004)
-   Compaq Visual Fortran 6.1

Differences occur between these compilers generally as follows:

  a) Output in "free format" differs slightly in spacing and number of digits.
  b) Precision may differ very slightly.
  c) In the Salford compiler KIND=1,2,3 represents single, double, and quad precision  respectively, where as in the other compilers the kinds are 4,8,16 respectively.


DISCLAIMER
----------
The program sources used in this book have been developed for the purpose of teaching; they are not necessarily suitable for serious application by the reader. Although the authors have attempted to make all programs free of errors the programs might contain errors. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!


Amendments
-----------
Changes in the program sources codes since the initial release are noted below.

Please send comments/corrections to the authors.
